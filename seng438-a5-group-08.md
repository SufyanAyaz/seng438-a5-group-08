# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

## Discussion on Decision Making Given A Target Failure Rate
A failure rate refers to the frequency of failures occurring within a time frame, therefore, a target failure rate is the failure rate that is expected to be achieved by the SUT in order to demonstrate an acceptable enough level of reliability.

The corrleation between the target failure rate and decision making when it comes to the SUT is that the target failure rate is compared with the current failure rate of the SUT and is used as a guide for developers when they are determining how much effort needs to be allocated to improving said SUT. When the chosen target failure rate is high, chances are that the SUT's current failure rate is already quite near, if not less than the target failure rate, and is therefore almost meeting its desired relaibility. In this scenario, developers can decide to allocate less time and resources towards testing to improve the SUT's reliability. On the other hand, if the chosen target failure rate is low, chances are that more failures are occuring than what is acceptable, making the current failure rate too high for the SUT to be considered as reliable. In this scenario, developers are forced to make the decision of allocating more time and resources to testing and analysing the SUT in order to reduce the number of failures occuring, and bring the failure rate down to a level that is acceptable enough to label the SUT as reliable.

To exemplify how the decision-making process can be affected by a target failure rate, we will calculate the failure of our SUT, the system used for failure report 9. In order to calculate the failure rate for a SUT, the formula is `λ = 1/MTTF`, where `MTTF (Mean Time to Failure) = Total Time/Number of Failures`. This means that for our system, the failure rate is calculated as follows:

`MTTF = Total Time/Number of Failures = 52.5 minutes/30 failures = 1.75 minutes per failure`

`λ = 1/MTTF = 1/1.75 minutes per failure = 0.5714 failures per minute = 0.00952 failures per second`

Using the formulas, we are able to calculate the failure rate of the system used in failure report 9 as being 0.00952 failures per second. Now, since we did not have a target failure rate, we can't make an exact decision on how developers should proceed with the system, but if we were given a target failure rate that is higher than 0.00952 failures per second, we would decide that the system is reliable enough and does not need to be further tested or analyzed. On the other hand, if we were given a target failure rate that is lower than 0.00952 failures per second, we would decide to allocate resources towards testing and analyzing the system, so that the number of failures is reduced and the system becomes reliable enough to be used in production.
